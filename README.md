TCENet: Texture-Color Enhancement Network in Synthetic Video Generation

To address the gap between real and synthetic flood image, we proposed GAN based texture color enhancement network TCENet to enhance the texture and color of synthetic flood image similar to real flood image. 

The TCENet comprised of enhancement network and segmentation network. The enhancement network is trained on unpaired synthetic and real flood images to enhance the texture and color of the synthetic images.
